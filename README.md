# Bachelor Thesis: Leveraging Generative AI for Behavioral AI interventions: Evidence from Polarization

## Project Description
This project explores whether empathetic conversations with AI can help mitigate political or ideological polarization.
Participants take a short pre-survey, interact with an AI designed to respond thoughtfully and empathetically to their opinions and complete a post-survey.
Built with Streamlit and powered by Llama 3.3 70B Instruct Turbo via Together.ai.

## Streamlit Application
The Streamlit app serves as the core component of the experiment:
1. **Pre-Survey** -  Measures participants' political attitudes and degrees of polarization.
2. **Interactive AI Conversation** - Participants engage with an empathetic AI that takes the opposite viewpoint while acknowledging their perspective.
3. **Post-Survey** - Re-measures polarization to assess potential changes.

All responses are stored to enable tailored AI interactions and following analysis.
